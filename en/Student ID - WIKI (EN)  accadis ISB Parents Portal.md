All students at the Secondary receive a Student ID card, valid for one school year. The expiry date is shown on a hologram, which is updated each school year at the same time as textbooks are handed out. If the student ID card is lost, a new one can be requested via the contact form in the [parents portal](https://www.accadis-isb.eu/isb-anfragen-inquiries) for an administrative fee of 10.00 â‚¬.

Parents of Elementary School students can request a Student ID once free-of-charge.
