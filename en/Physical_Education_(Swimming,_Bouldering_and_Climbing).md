## Physical Education

To ensure that P.E. lessons can get under way speedily, please consider the following in relation to clothing on the days your child has P.E.:

-   sport clothes labelled with the student’s name
-   sports shoes with non-marking soles for the sports hall
-   younger children wear shoes with velcro fasteners
-   no „complicated“ clothes as the children have to get changed on their own
-   no jewelry (watch, necklace, earrings) brought to school

If a student cannot participate in P.E. fully or is injured, we require a written note. A doctor’s certificate is needed if a child’s ability to take part is affected for a prolonged period of time. This also applies to swimming lessons in Grade 3.
