## Grades and Report Cards\ 

Elementary School Students receive a report card at the end of the first semester and again for the second semester on the last day of school before the [summer break](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Holidays,_Public_Holidays_and_Bridge_Days "Holidays, Public Holidays and Bridge Days"). The report cards for Primary class and Grade 1 students contain written statements about their development in a number of areas: individual subjects, work and learning behavior, specific skills and weaknesses, social skills, willingness to engage, and participation in lessons. Grade 2 students also receive such a report card at the end of the first semester.

Grade 3 and Grade 4 students receive a report card at the end of each semester showing grades to evaluate the students’ performance in each subject, as well as their work ethic and social skills. It may also contain written comments, supplementing or replacing grades. Grade 2 students receive this type of report card in the second half of the year.

The grades in the individual subjects are based on written and oral performance and are weighted differently according to each subject. The [subject teachers](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher") will provide you with further details. Should you have any questions about a grade in a particular subject, please contact the relevant [subject teacher](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher").

The class conference decides on the grade for work ethic and social skills and includes behavior outside lessons, e.g. during break and play time, field and [school trips](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/School_Trips "School Trips"), etc. Should you have questions, please address them to the [homeroom teacher](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher").

When grading the student‘s performance in the individual subjects, the following descriptors apply:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Note 1 (excellent)</td><td>if the student’s performance fully meets, and often exceeds, the standards</td></tr><tr><td>Note 2 (good)</td><td>if the student’s performance meets the standards fully</td></tr><tr><td>Note 3 (satisfactory)</td><td>if the student’s performance generally meets the standards</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4 (adequate)</td><td>if the student’s performance reveals gaps in knowledge and understanding, but broadly still meets the standards</td></tr><tr><td>Note 5 (insufficient)</td><td>if the student’s performance does not meet the standards at present, yet sufficient basic understanding is in evidence which may enable the student to overcome the issues in the foreseeable future</td></tr><tr><td>Note 6 (unsatisfactory)</td><td>if the student’s performance does not meet the standards, and there is not sufficient basic understanding in evidence which would enable the student to overcome the issues in the foreseeable future</td></tr></tbody></table>

When grading the student‘s work ethic and social skills, the following descriptors apply:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Note 1 (excellent)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills are outstanding</td></tr><tr><td>Note 2 (good)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills meet the standard completely</td></tr><tr><td>Note 3 (satisfactory)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills generally meet the standard</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4 (inconsistent)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills are, at times, insufficient, but most-ly still acceptable</td></tr><tr><td>Note 5 (insufficient)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills are usually not acceptable</td></tr><tr><td>Note 6 (unsatisfactory)</td><td>if the student’s work ethic and social skills are almost always not acceptable and various disciplinary measures and consequences do not result in change or improvement.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Report Cards Secondary School\ 

Each student receives two reports during the school year, one at the end of the first semester and another at the end of the school year. Additionally, Grade 9 to 12 students receive Mid-term Reports before the Autumn and Easter breaks. Students receive a grade for every subject reflecting not only their performance in tests and assessed pieces of work, but also the quality of their day-to-day classwork and [homework](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homework_and_Planners "Homework and Planners"). In addition to the subject grades, students also receive a grade for their work ethic and social skills, evaluating their effort and attitude across all subject areas, including their behavior in and outside of classroom situations such as school excursions, break times etc. If, after receiving a school report, you have a question regarding the grade for a specific subject please make an appointment with the individual subject teacher. If you have any questions regarding the grades for work ethic and social skills please contact the Homeroom teacher.
