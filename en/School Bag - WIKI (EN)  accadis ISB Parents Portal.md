From Primary class onwards your child requires a proper school bag which is suitable for carrying note-books, folders and other material properly. Please check your childâ€™s school bag daily and sort it out together with your child. In particular, please make sure that the pencil case is in good condition, i.e. no items are missing and pencils are sharpened.
