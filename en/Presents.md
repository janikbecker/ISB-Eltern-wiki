It is important that, if you wish to give a present to your child’s teacher, it is merely a small token of appreciation. Large gifts could be construed for a parent to court favours for the future and will put the member of staff into the awkward position of having to refuse your gift.

The following general guidelines apply:

-   There is no expectation that a parent gives a present to a teacher to show their appreciation. A verbal ‘Thank you’, a handwritten note or a picture drawn by a child mean a lot to an educator.

-   Presents from one family to a member of staff must not exceed the value of €10.00.

-   Should several families wish to give a combined present to a teacher, the contributing families must be clearly identifiable and the value per family must not exceed €10.00. A teacher must declare any presents that exceed the value of €50.00 to a member of the school’s management and leadership team.

-   Cash must not be given.

-   Vouchers are acceptable.
