## Nutrition\ 

Successful learning and healthy food are closely linked. Your child’s break time snack should help your him or her to concentrate and study efficiently until lunch break. If your child eats only a small breakfast at home, they need a hearty break time snack at school. The break time snack should de-pend on what and how much your child eats for breakfast at home. At best the snack should consist of (whole wheat) bread, fresh fruit or vegetables, a dairy product and a sugar-free drink. Chewing gum is not allowed.

A balanced diet is important for the development of children and adolescents. Regarding your child’s nutrition, we particularly depend on your support. Processed foods such as croissants, sweet pas-tries, chocolate and cereal bars contain a lot of fat and/or sugar and are not considered a healthy breakfast.

If you provide your child with a water bottle they can fill it up as many times as they wish from the water dispenser in the Canteen.

## Catering\ 

At accadis ISB we attach great importance to a joint lunch. Therefore, it is obligatory for children to participate in the school lunch. For students in Grade 11 and 12 a flexible vouchersysten has been introduced. The vouchers can only be ordered directly from FPS Catering via this [link](https://www.fps-catering.de/onlineformular-accadis-voucher). FPS catering is your contractual partner responsible for providing lunch at accadis ISB. Please direct any questions or suggestions regarding lunch by [email](mailto:team-schulekita@fps-catering.de).

FPS Catering has been catering successfully for schools and day-care facilities since 1978. It was the first Catering company in the Rhein-Main-area to be awarded an EU certificate for organic products. The company makes a point of using regionally sourced produce.

When creating meals, FPS Catering looks to recommendations of the German Nutrition Society (DGE). FPS Catering does not use „light“-products and flavor enhancers. FPS Catering considers how preferences and food trends can be integrated into the weekly menu, as long as they are compatible with healthy nutrition.

## Breakfast and Snacktime Preschool\ 

A healthy sugarfree breakfast is especially important for children. Essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fibre, enzymes and micronutrients support physical growth, strengthen nerves and help your child to concentrate. A well-balanced, healthy sugarfree breakfast provides the necessary energy for the daily activities. Especially children who are still growing need to replenish their energy resources in the morning. „A combination of bread, fresh fruits or raw vegetables as well as a dairy product are exactly what your child needs“ according to the German Nutrition Society (DGE).

Fruit squeezies, yoghurt with sugar, yoghurt drinks, bananas, sweets, pastries and cake are not suitable for breakfast and **we will give them back to the children to take home again**. Please support us in our work and pack a healthy breakfast for your child. We aim to let children consciously experience the importance of a healthy breakfast and to regard it as normal. Additionally, it strengthens the feeling of togetherness when all children take a healthy breakfast to school and nobody brings in sweets. [Birthday parties](/en/Children%E2%80%99s_birthdays "Children’s birthdays") are an exception.

## Lunch Elementary School\ 

During the lunch break one staff member is on [duty](/en/Supervision "Supervision") in the cafeteria and helps children to carry their trays, pays attention to their table manners, and checks whether children hang their jackets and caps in the cloakroom area during lunch.

The various areas of the school yard (climbing frame, football pitch, area in front of the cafeteria) are supervised by teachers and assistants.
