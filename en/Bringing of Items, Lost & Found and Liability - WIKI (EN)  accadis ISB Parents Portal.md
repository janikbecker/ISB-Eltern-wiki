## Ball games in school\ 

For safety reasons, leather balls or other hard balls are banned from school grounds except for the soccer and basketball pitch. Students of accadis Elementary School may only use soft sports balls to play on the soccer and basketball pitch. Students of accadis Secondary School may use hard or leather sports balls on the pitch as long as no accadis Elementary School students are present at the same time.

## Mobile phones\ 

accadis ISB students are not allowed to use a mobile phone at school. If you would like your child to carry a phone for the journey to and from school, please be aware that it must be switched off and stored in the student’s [locker](/en/Lockers "Lockers") during the school day. The same rule applies to other electronic devices, such as smart watches, tablets, games consoles etc. Please do not attempt to call your child on the mobile or to leave messages whilst he or she is at school.

## Lost & Found\ 

Please label your child’s belongings with their name (sport clothes, jackets, slippers, pencil case, snack box, etc.). Any items found around the school will be put in the Lost & Found Box, which is located next to the main entrance. The box for the accadis Preschool is located in the Preschool hallway.

Any lunch boxes and drinking bottles containing leftover food will be disposed of each Friday afternoon.

Any items that have not been collected by the last day of school before the winter, Easter or summer break are given to aid organizations or disposed of during the school [holiday](/en/Holidays,_Public_Holidays_and_Bridge_Days "Holidays, Public Holidays and Bridge Days").

## Liability\ 

In the event of willful damage or gross negligence, bodily injury, and theft, the perpetrator (or their legal guardian) is solely responsible and liable. The school is not responsible for personal possessions, especially valuables such as watches, rings, keys etc.

It is common in Germany to take out liability insurance. This optional, but highly advisable insurance insures against damage claims by third parties.

If a student causes damage, compensation is generally provided by the parents’ (or legal guardian’s) liability insurance. Should they not have taken out liability insurance, they are personally liable in full.
