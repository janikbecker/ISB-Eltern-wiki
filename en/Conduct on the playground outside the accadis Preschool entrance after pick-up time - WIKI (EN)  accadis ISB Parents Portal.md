The playground in front of the entrance of the accadis Preschool as well as the playground of the accadis Elementary and Secondary School is used after 15:15 for Child and Student Care. All members of staff take their responsibility of [supervision](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Supervision "Supervision") very seriously and do their best to keep the children safe on both playgrounds. Hence it is important that the supervisor has a good view of the children in his or her care. **We ask parents to bear this in mind and hence not to access the playgrounds after [pick-up](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Drop_off_and_Pick_up "Drop off and Pick up") or to allow their children to continue playing in these areas.**
