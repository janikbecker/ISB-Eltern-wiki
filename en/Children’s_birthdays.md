Birthdays are a special occasion for each child and therefore they are welcome to mark this day with their classmates by bringing baked goods, small treats or healthy alternatives to their class or group. Please do not hand out ‘goody bags’ to the other children and refrain from distributing birthday invitations for your child at school, unless all the children of a class or group are invited.
