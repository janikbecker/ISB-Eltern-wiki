No longer wearing nappies is a big step towards independence for the children. They show that they are gaining control of their own body and functions and are taking on more responsibility for their own lives. This change is something desirable but it can also come with insecurities and fears in some children. In order to be completely toilet trained a child must have passed through several developmental stages and have reached a certain level of mental and physical maturity.

In order to be toilet-trained, a child needs to be in control of their bladder and sphincter muscles, which means that a child must be able to clench these muscles for a period of time.

A child must also be able to show in good time that they want to go to the toilet. Most children are usually only able to master this by the age of two and if toilet training begins too early, it can take much longer for a child to master it.

Our role in your child’s toilet training is to support the children’s own initiatives and work with you parents in a way that does not ask too much of the child.

We give children ample opportunity to practice going to the toilet:

-   going to the toilet before putting a new nappy on when changing nappies
-   going to the toilet together with children who are already toilet-trained
-   not using nappies for periods of time
-   a teacher always comes along to the toilet to help

We motivate the children with praise and approval for any effort, stay calm when things go wrong. Furthermore, we take time to and talk to the children about their feelings and fears, occasionally supported by suitable literature.

Parents can support us by doing the following:

-   use separate underpants and shirts instead of all-in-one body suits
-   dress your child in trousers that it can easily open and pull down itself
-   pack sufficient change of underwear
