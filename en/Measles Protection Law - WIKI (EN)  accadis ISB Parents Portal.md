The _Masernschutzgesetz_ (German Measles Protection Law) came into force on 01.03.2020 (more information [here](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/impfpflicht.html)). This law requires that all children attending kindergarten or school must have both measles vaccinations recommended by the German Vaccination Commission (_Ständige Impfkommission_). Proof can be provided by the Impfausweis (international certificate of vaccination – Yellow Card), the _gelbe Kinderuntersuchungsheft_ (yellow children’s examination booklet) or by a medical certificate – especially if children already had measles.

As a school, we are subject to the legal requirements. Therefore, we require proof of the legally required vaccination certificate prior to your child’s first day of school at accadis International School.
