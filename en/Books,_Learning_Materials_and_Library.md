Students must look after the books they have borrowed and any books lost or damaged will have to be replaced.

## Books and learning materials Elementary School\ 

Students own their exercise books. Therefore, they may write in them and keep them when they move into another grade or leave accadis ISB.

Students in Grades 1 to 4 do **not** own the textbooks and learning material, but borrow them from accadis ISB. Textbooks and learning material must be treated with care. **Books must be covered and labelled with the child’s name**. If a child moves into a new grade or leaves the school, all books must be returned.

If books or learning materials are lost or damaged, parents are responsible and will have to pay for a replacement. This responsibility also applies to fittings and property of accadis ISB in general, and includes willful damage or theft. Please consider taking out [liability](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Bringing_of_Items,_Lost_%26_Found_and_Liability "Bringing of Items, Lost & Found and Liability") insurance.

## Bücher und Lehrmittel in der Secondary School\ 

In Grades 5 to 10, textbooks are provided by the school free of charge. Textbooks are handed out at the beginning of the school year and collected in again at the end of the year. Students are responsible for covering their textbooks, taking good care of them and to return them in good condition. Any damaged or lost books must be replaced by the parents ([Liability](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Bringing_of_Items,_Lost_%26_Found_and_Liability "Bringing of Items, Lost & Found and Liability")).

However, teachers may sometimes ask students during the course of the school year to purchase specific texts that they are working on in class e.g. a novel in English.

Workbooks or textbooks that are used in small group support teaching are to be purchased by the students.

Parents are responsible for providing all other materials required in the school [materials list](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/School_Supplies "School Supplies").
