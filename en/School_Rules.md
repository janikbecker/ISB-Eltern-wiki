Our accadis ISB rules are based on mutual respect. We treat each other with honesty, fairness, cooperation, respect and tolerance.

In all parts of the school, during lessons or break time, students are expected to:

-   behave in a friendly and respectful manner towards members of staff and other students
-   follow the instructions of teachers or other members of the school staff
-   be tolerant of other people's characteristics and opinions
-   value individual differences
-   be helpful if someone requires assistance
-   treat school property with care
-   refrain from eating or drinking outside of designated areas, or chewing gum
-   walk quietly in the hallways and on stairs, on the right, if possible
-   allow others to pass and sit against the wall when changing shoes

We will not tolerate any physical aggression, nor any form of bullying in our school. Students who exhibit such behavior will face strict consequences. All accadis ISB faculty and staff are asked to immediately report such behavior.
