## Entwicklungsberichte in der Preschool\ 

To make each childâ€™s personal development trans-parent and visible for parents, we keep files in the groups on all children (structured education and development documentation). Based on the pro-gress reports, parents have the opportunity to speak personally with teachers and Preschool staff once a year at the [Parent Teacher Conferences](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Parent_Evenings,_Parent_Meetings_and_Parent_Teacher_Conferences "Parent Evenings, Parent Meetings and Parent Teacher Conferences"). At the end of the accadis Preschool year, you will receive a Progress Report for your child.
