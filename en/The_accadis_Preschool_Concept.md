Our Preschool concept focuses on bilingual education in German and English by using the [immersion method](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/The_immersion_method_at_accadis_Preschool_and_Elementary_School "The immersion method at accadis Preschool and Elementary School"), physical education and activity. In addition, an international focus and exposure to diverse cultures is something we live and foster on a daily basis. We are using a holistic approach to help your child develop, including a healthy, balanced diet and positive social interactions.
