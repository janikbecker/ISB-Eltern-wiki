If a student’s behaviour does not conform to the rules and expectations, disciplinary measures may be taken. Most issues with students are likely to be relatively minor and can be addressed by the member of staff directly, perhaps with the assistance of the student’s homeroom teacher. If, at any point, there is a risk to the personal safety of any member of the accadis ISB school community, help from another adult is sought immediately.

Disciplinary measures may be taken as listed below. They are in no special order; depending on the incident or the misdemeanor, one or several measures may be taken.

-   Verbal warning
-   Time Out
-   A talk with the [Elementary School Coordinator](/en/Role:Elementary_School_Coordinator "Role:Elementary School Coordinator") or [Secondary School Coordinator](/en/Role:Secondary_School_Coordinator "Role:Secondary School Coordinator")
-   Withdrawal of privileges
-   Consequence Time
-   Suspension for up to 5 days
-   Expulsion

All tests and quizzes that are missed during suspension must be completed when the student returns to school. During this time, the student should continue working at home and bring in any completed work or graded assignments when they return.
