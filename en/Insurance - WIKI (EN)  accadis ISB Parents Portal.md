All students are insured against damage to persons and materials/property by law. The insurance covers situiations related to school. Your child is insured as follows:

-   on his or her direct way to and from school, without detours
-   during joint events which are organized and supervised by a teacher, for example, field and [school trips](https://en.wiki.accadis-isb.net/School_Trips "School Trips")
-   during school sport events
-   during break time.

Students must remain on the school premises during lessons and break times for the insurance cover to be valid. According to section 4 of the Verordnung 端ber die Aufsicht 端ber Sch端lerinnen und Sch端ler (AufsVO) (German regulation on obligatory supervision regarding students) a school is neither subject to obligatory [supervision](https://en.wiki.accadis-isb.net/Supervision "Supervision") nor liable if students leave the school premises without permission. Therefore, students are not insured if they leave the school premises without permission.

The school permission gives permission to the IB students (Grades 11 and 12) to leave the school premises during lunch break to obtain lunch supplies. If the parents of an IB student do not wish for their child to leave the premises, they must inform the school in writing.
