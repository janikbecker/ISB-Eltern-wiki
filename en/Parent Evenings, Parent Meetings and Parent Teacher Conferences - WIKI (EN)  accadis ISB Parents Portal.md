We believe that a trusting and close collaboration between parents and school is essential to create a positive learning environment for each child. Reciprocity between home and school reflects what we value in terms of respect, understanding and sharing. There are a number of occasions throughout the school year where parents can learn about their child’s progress.

At the beginning of each school year there is a Back-to-School-Night. This is a chance to learn about the program and expectations for the school year. At these parents’ evenings, parent representatives and their deputies and the class treasurer are elected.

Additional parent evenings may take place during the school year and are held by the respective [Homeroom](/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher") and Preschool teachers.

Parent Teacher Conferences take place twice a year, once in each semester, for parents to discuss their child’s progress with the [homeroom and subject teachers](/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher"). In the Preschool, the Conference takes place once a year.

Appointments may be requested on an individual basis with a teacher, ideally vịa the [online form](https://www.accadis-isb.eu/isb-anfragen-inquiries). Please understand that these appointments have to be arranged in advance and it is not possible for teachers to meet parents without an appointment. Parent meetings are held either before the start of the school day or after school has finished.
