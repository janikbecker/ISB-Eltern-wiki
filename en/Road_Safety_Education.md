In Grade 4, students take part in the policeâ€™s road safety education program in order to become familiar with traffic rules and to practice them while cycling. Discipline is an important priority for the traffic police during the program and students who fail to follow instructions are excluded from the practical elements of road safety education. Students who complete the practical and theoretical education course successfully are awarded with a cycling proficiency certificate.
