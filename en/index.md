## Welcome to the accadis International School Bad Homburg – accadis ISB!\ 

Dear Parents,

Welcome to accadis ISB. We hope that this handbook will provide you with all the information you require to help you and your children settle into accadis ISB quickly. We have included information on pedagogical matters, day-to-day life in the school, [school rules](/en/School_Rules "School Rules") and regulations and our expectations of the students, both academically and socially.

It is our goal to encourage the children’s natural curiosity, to strengthen their self-confidence and to ensure that they enjoy learning. At the same time, we want to inspire respect in our students for other people and cultures as well as foster their natural talents and creativity.

accadis ISB offers a challenging [academic curriculum](/en/Curriculum "Curriculum"), but, at the same time, provides a wide range of opportunities to nurture and support, so that every student can realize his or her full potential.

A good relationship between accadis ISB, the teachers and parents is very important and through [communication](/en/Communication_and_Collaboration "Communication and Collaboration") based on trust and mutual support, we hope to ensure the best education possible for your child.

Please read this handbook carefully so that you are familiar with the accadis ISB philosophy, culture and routines. If, after reading this, you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact with us.

We are happy that you have chosen our learning establishment and wish your child a happy and successful time here at accadis ISB.

Best regards,

Janina Sparks  
Head of School
