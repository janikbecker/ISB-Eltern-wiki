Field and school trips are an essential part of school life and the curriculum. Field and school trips usually take place from Grade 3 onwards. The [Homeroom teacher](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher") or relevant subject teacher will inform you about any planned school trip ahead of time. All students are expected to attend. If, in exceptional circumstances, your child is unable to do so, he or she still needs to come to school, joining a different class or grade, as necessary.
