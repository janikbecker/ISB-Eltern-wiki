Every student is assigned a locker at the beginning of the school year. Items that are not needed in the classroom (e.g. jacket, outdoor shoes, [sports kit](/en/Physical_Education_and_Swimming "Physical Education and Swimming")) may be kept in it. It is the childrenâ€™s responsibility to keep the lockers clean and tidy. Lunch boxes should not be kept in the lockers. If a padlock owned by the school is lost or the locker is damaged, parents are responsible and will have to pay for a replacement or repairs.
