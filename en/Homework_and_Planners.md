## Homework and Planners Elementary School 

Until Grade 2 our curriculum focuses on learning to read and write in German and English. Therefore, we recommend that you read regularly at home with your child. Additional, individual homework may be given to help a child catch up on missed lesson content following an [absence](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Attendance,_Absence,_Cancellation_of_Classes_and_Compulsory_Education "Attendance, Absence, Cancellation of Classes and Compulsory Education") from school or if further practice is advisable because of a slow work speed.

From Grade 3 onwards students are introduced to homework as a task to be completed independently. Students write down all homework in their planner, which we ask you to sign each weekend. Signatures are checked on Mondays to ensure that parents are informed about tasks or homework.

With accadis ISB being an all-day school, we aim to integrate additional exercises into those extra lessons. However, your child may occasionally require your support, for example when learning to recite poems by heart, practicing addition and multiplication tables or reading. The same applies for preparation for quizzes and tests. The [subject teachers](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher") can advise you on how to best support your child.

## Homework and Planners Secondary School 

Homework is an activity that students are required to complete outside of normal lessons. It is a vital part of any studentsâ€™ learning and becomes increasingly important as students get older. Homework allows students to consolidate and extend skills and knowledge they have acquired in lessons. In addition, students develop their organizational and time management skills.

Please help your child to complete his or her homework by finding a quiet space at home, where they can work undisturbed. If your child has any difficulties with a particular piece of work encourage him or her to discuss it with you but also let the individual teacher know that there was a problem.

Every student until Grade 10 is provided with an accadis planner. They should take this to every lesson and use it to record down any homework, tests or other important messages or information from the teachers. Using the planner regularly will help the students to become organized and plan their time effectively.

The planner is also another form of communication between home and school. Teachers may write a message to you in it about something that has happened at school but parents can also use it to communicate with individual teachers, for example if a child has experienced difficulties when completing homework.

Please check the planner regularly and sign it at the end of every week.
