The **accadis ISB Parent-Teacher Association (PTA)** is a community-driven organization that fosters closer relationships between parents, students, and school staff across the Bilingual Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary School levels. Every parent with a child enrolled at accadis ISB is automatically a member, and together, we strive to enrich the educational and social experience for all students.

### PTA Structure and Leadership

The PTA is guided by a Board comprising the **Chair, Treasurer, and Heads of each Committee**, ensuring focused leadership in key areas that enhance school life. Supporting the Board are the **Chair Deputy and the Board Secretary**, who assist in organizing and executing the PTA’s initiatives. The Board also includes **representatives from both the School and Preschool**, who take part in the monthly meetings during the school year, fostering open communication between the PTA and school leadership. The PTA Board members serve two-year terms and work closely with the accadis Parent Council, reporting regularly on activities and progress.

### Committees and Their Roles

The PTA is organized into five key committees, each contributing in unique ways to the accadis community:

-   **Celebration Committee**  
    Responsible for planning social and festive events, the Celebration Committee organizes activities such as the Summer Fair and Sports Day, providing snacks and refreshments. They also arrange special treats for festive occasions like Christmas, Easter, and St. Martin’s Day (Weckermann).
-   **Performing Arts Committee**  
    This committee supports the accadis Club of Theatre (aCT), Band, Choir, and other performance activities, assisting with ticket sales, stage setup, and equipment for school performances. The committee also collaborates with teachers to enhance music and performance opportunities for students.
-   **Library Committee**  
    Focused on fostering a love of reading, the Library Committee organizes annual bilingual Book Fairs and events for Literacy Month, including author visits and book donation drives, to expand the school library's resources. They work closely with the English and German Departments to align library initiatives with the curriculum.
-   **Road Safety Committee**  
    This committee collaborates with school management to analyze and propose improved pick-up and drop-off procedures. They also organize Traffic Safety Days and other educational initiatives within the accadis community to raise awareness about safety on and around campus.
-   **Uniforms Committee**  
    The Uniforms Committee organizes regular bazaars for gently used uniforms, working closely with the school’s uniform supplier to address parent feedback and ensure quality and timely delivery.

### Funding and Finances

The PTA is funded through annual contributions collected via class funds. These contributions support both routine activities and special projects, including school-sanctioned events, facility improvements, and charitable initiatives. The PTA’s finances are managed within the School’s accounting team, with all transactions confirmed through Board decisions and the co-signature of the Treasurer and the Chair. This ensures transparency and adherence to the PTA’s financial guidelines.

### Communication Channels

To stay updated on PTA activities, parents are encouraged to regularly follow the PTA’s Google Classroom, where announcements, updates, and events are posted. Additionally, the PTA WhatsApp Community offers a more informal communication channel and requires joining by interested parents via [link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JYdvo3nQdrK6XdauPIPKOP).
