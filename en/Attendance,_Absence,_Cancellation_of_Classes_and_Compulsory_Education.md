## Attendance 

## Introduction 

For our students to gain the greatest benefit from their education it is vital that they attend lessons regularly. We expect that each student attend school every day during term time unless the reason for the absence is unavoidable.

All members of the accadis ISB community, parents, students and teachers, are working together so that students attend school regularly.

## Punctuality 

Homeroom starts at 08:15 hrs and ends at 08:30 hrs. [Teachers](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher) take the students’ attendance during Homeroom. Students are expected to be in their Homeroom registration period at 08:15 hrs, when important announcements and news for the day are given. Poor punctuality is not acceptable. If a student arrives late this will be recorded in the attendance register and noted on the [report card](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Grades_and_Report_Cards).

## Why regular attendance is so important? 

**Academic progress**: Any absence affects the pattern of a child’s schooling and regular absence will seriously affect their learning. Any student’s absence can disrupt teaching routines thus affecting the learning of others in the same class.

**Sense of Belonging**: All students are part of the community that is accadis ISB. Repeated absences can lead to a student not experiencing this sense of belonging to the same degree. He or she may feel somewhat disconnected from the learning experiences and the social dynamics of the group, which, in turn, can make future absences more likely.

**Extra work at home**: It is the responsibility of the student to catch up on all work missed in class. Parents ought to bear in mind that the classroom experience cannot be replicated with extra work at home. Absences may have a negative impact on the students’ academic progress and may affect their promotion to the next grade.

## Absence 

Ensuring your child’s regular attendance at school is the parents’ responsibility, unless the reason for the absence is unavoidable.

Parents are informed about their child’s attendance as part of the [Report Card](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Grades_and_Report_Cards) issued at the end of each semester.

## Illness 

If your child is unwell, please do not send him or her to school.

Please only use the online form to inform of us of your child’s absence and let us know **by 08:15 hrs at the latest**.

If your child is suffering from an infectious disease (e.g. chicken pox, head lice, strep throat, scarlet fever) you are obliged to disclose this information via the online form.

-   Please inform the school on the first day of absence, and on each subsequent day of absence. Please only use the [online form](http://accadis.eu/student-absences). Please do not phone the school about the absence.

-   The school reserves the right to request a medical certificate in case of frequent absence.

-   If the illness occurs just before or after the school holidays, a doctor’s note is required from the first day for all students.

If your child does not turn up at school and we have not been notified, we will contact you. This is to ascertain that nothing has happened on the way to school. However, this takes up significant administrative time, which can be avoided if you have informed us via the online form in time.

## Lateness or early departure from school owing to a doctor’s appointment 

If your child is late or has to leave school early owing to a doctor’s appointment, please inform us **no later than the day before** via the [online form](http://accadis.eu/student-absences).

Please note that for Elementary School students, an **early pick-up is only possible at the beginning breakfast or lunch time**. For Secondary School students, besides the break times, pick-up is also possible at the end of each period.

## Acceptable and unacceptable reasons for absences 

**Acceptable reasons for absences include**:

-   Illness
-   A medical appointment
-   Observing a religious holiday
-   Family reasons (a family emergency or a special celebration or anniversary)
-   University interviews

With the exception of emergencies or illnesses, the School leadership or Homeroom teacher must be informed of such absences beforehand.

**Unauthorized absences include**:

-   Family holidays
-   Visiting relatives
-   University visits

## Request for Leave of Absence 

In exceptional circumstances students may be granted absence from school if the parents request it, however, leave of absence is given at the discretion of the school.

If the absence is for a period of up to two days the request should be sent to the Homeroom teacher via the [online form](http://accadis.eu/student-absences).

If the absence is for more than two days, or adjacent to a vacation then the request must be sent to the Administrative Deputy Head at least four weeks beforehand.

accadis ISB will not authorize students’ absences from lessons for holiday travel. If students undertake these during term time regardless, this absence will be recorded as unauthorised.

The school will not authorize an absence during the following times:

-   When a student has just started at the school. This is a very important time to settle into the new environment as quickly as possible.

-   Immediately before and during assessment periods, school examinations and IGCSE and IBDP examinations

-   When a student’s attendance record already shows a high level of absence.

## Persistent Absenteeism 

A student becomes a “persistent absentee” when his or her attendance record is a cause for concern. Absence at this level is doing considerable damage to the child’s educational prospects and the school endeavours to work especially closely with the parents to address this:

1.  Homeroom or subject teacher discuss a student’s attendance record at a class conference if a he or she is absent for more than 10% of the days in school or 10% of lessons given in a particular subject
2.  Parents are invited to a meeting to establish the circumstances and next steps are agreed
3.  If attendance does not improve, an ‘attendance contract’ is defined during a further meeting with the School leadership and the parents.
4.  Failure to abide by the attendance policy (including the attendance contract) may lead to a student no being promoted to the next grade in the following academic year.

**If a student is absent from school for more than 18 days in an academic year, he or she may not be promoted to the next grade level at the end of the year.**

All absences, authorized or unauthorized, shall be recorded on the [report card](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Grades_and_Report_Cards "Grades and Report Cards").

## Unscheduled cancellation of classes 

In the event of an emergency or exceptional circumstances e.g. heavy snow, the school will contact parents directly by email. Although the school may cancel lessons and compulsory attendance may be suspended, members of staff will be in school and provide supervision for all students who are present.

## Compulsory education and attendance 

When starting school in the Primary class, your child is subject to the regulations for compulsory education and must attend lessons. In the event of special leave of absence, the guidelines stated under Attendance must be complied with.
