## Concerns and suggestions\ 

Concerns and suggestions Open communication and a partnership between home and school will help us provide the best education for your child. Whenever a concern or problem arises, please “go to the source” first i.e. go to the person directly involved by either writing to them or making an appointment. This way, teachers can respond quickly to give you first-hand information and, in the spirit of open communication, difficulties can be resolved.

If, after a meeting, the situation remains unresolved or you need more information then please ask to be referred to other school staff, for example the ES or SeS Coordinators or one of the Deputy Heads.

## Cooperation between accadis Preschool and parents\ 

People who share a common goal need to co-operate. The common goal of accadis Preschool and parents is to cooperate in the best interests of your child and for all interactions between parents, children and Preschool staff to be based on trust.

The top priority of the cooperation between accadis Preschool and parents is the well-being of the child. For this common goal staff and parents work together, considering joint steps and trying these out. The next step is to assess whether the set goal has been achieved. Children note if parents and the Preschool staff cooperate well and sense the positive attitude from both sides. Children learn from positive role models at home and at accadis ISB Preschool.

The well-being and development of the children are the most important priority for the Preschool staff. Should we notice any particular issues, either behavioral or developmental, we will make an appointment to discuss these with you. We will let you know what our concerns are, based on what we have observed. Together with you, we want to try to get an overall picture of your child at home and at school. We will try to find the possible cause of the behavior and, **collaboratively**, identify ways to improve the situation. In our experience these discussions usually have a positive outcome and no further action is necessary. However, there are also children whose development requires professional support that cannot be provided solely by either accadis ISB Preschool or the parents. This support can come from an occupational therapist, speech therapist, pediatrician etc. It is important that this additional support is viewed positively. Outside support is sought because the children’s welfare, as individuals and in their interactions within the group, is at the heart of everything we do.

Definition of child welfare: “To foster a child’s welfare, the child needs to be provided with an environment that allows him or her to develop physical, emotional, mental, personal, social, practical and other qualities, skills and relationships, which increasingly enable him or her to take care of his or her own well-being in accordance with legal norm and reality.“ (Sponsel, 2003)

If we at accadis Preschool, see a child’s welfare compromised by problematic behavior then we view it as our responsibility to work together with parents to try and find a solution. If this means working with outside experts then this should be viewed in a positive light.
