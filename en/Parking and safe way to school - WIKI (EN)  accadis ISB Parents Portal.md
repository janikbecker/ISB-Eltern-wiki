„Getting to school safely“ – a hot topic at every school. Everybody nods in agreement when the subject of safety is brought up, and everybody has something to say or ask for with regard to it. The solution is to lead by example and to do so together.

For that reason, we have checked the different routes leading to accadis ISB from the local bus stops to the underground station and the streets around the school for safety issues in order to find the safest way for your children to get to school. The resulting handbook “Getting to school safely” is meant to improve the safety of your children‘s way to school as well as make that way less stressful and more efficient. The positive consequences are lessons that can begin on time and with everybody present along with a stress-free and effective learning environment. Therefore, we kindly ask you to use the routes we suggest in this handbook and tell your children to use them, too.

## Safety and security\ 

Safety is very important for accadis ISB. Not just the safety and security in our building and on our premises are essential to us, but also getting there safely. Therefore, we have installed secure footpaths and have marked the routes to school. Various measures add up to a higher degree of safety at accadis ISB:

-   Outside the drop-off and pick-up times the premises and building must be entered via the accadis ISB Office (Visitor’s entrance, Am Weidenring 56).
-   There are two safe footpaths inside and two safe routes to our premises in order to keep our students away from driving cars.

In order to come to consistent security regulations, we have to make sure that parents are not in the classrooms or the school building during the day.

## Insurance\ 

All students are insured against bodily injury and property damage. Insurance takes effect for all activities related to the school. Your child is insured:

-   on its direct way to school (on the way there and back without detours)
-   during common activities of children and students that are supervised by a teacher or educator; the activity must have been organized by a teacher or educator, e.g. field trips, school trips, excursions
-   during sports events and
-   during break times

The important thing is that children and students must remain on the school compound during classes and break times. In case a student or child leaves the school compound without permission, the school’s supervision duty and liability cease and with it the insurance coverage according to § 4 of the „Verordnung über die Aufsicht über Schülerinnen und Schüler AufsVO “ (student supervision regulations)!

## General information and overview\ 

accadis International School is located at the SÜDCAMPUS in Ober-Eschbach, a suburb of Bad Homburg. On the following pages you will find a map of the accadis ISB premises. All parking lots, entrances for Preschool, Elementary School and Secondary School are marked on it.

## Safely entering and leaving the school premises\ 

There are two different possibilities to get to the accadis ISB school building safely and easily. We would generally like to ask you to not let your children cross the parking lot, since children are thereby exposed to traffic there we cannot control. To allow children to safely cross our premises, two secure footpaths have been created.

accadis ISB is accessible from the path “Im Kirschgrund” (underground station, bus stop, lay-by) and the street “Am Weidenring”.

## From the underground station, bus stop and lay-by Ober-Eschbacher Straße\ 

1.  Go straight on along “Im Kirschgrund” to the entrance at the Res Pitch.
2.  Go through the big gate next to the sports field, then right through the small gate to the playground ES and SeS.
3.  Go across the playground ES and SeS.

Parents of the Preschool either hand over their child at the small gate to the Preschool playground (picture 3) or walk around the building towards the main entrance ES and SeS and hand over their child at the glass door of the respective group (picture 4).

Elementary and Secondary School students also walk around the building (picture 4) and enter the school through the main entrance.
