Hygiene is an important issue in Preschool. At the beginning of the Preschool year as well as continuously in conversation, we teach children about the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Washing hands (after going to the toilet, before mealtimes, after mealtimes, after sneezing or blowing one’s nose, after playing outside in the playground etc.), cleaning tables after mealtimes, sweeping the floors and wearing slippers are some of the topics and activities children encounter every day. Educators are role models as well and therefore always wear slippers in Preschool. That is why we ask parents not to enter the group with outdoor shoes. Children play on the carpets and therefore, these should not get dirty. We hope for your understanding and consideration.

Children in the Daisy Group and younger children in the Sunflower groups can take an afternoon nap. The Preschool provides mattresses and duvets. The duvet cover needs to be provided by the parents and be washed at home every two weeks. The Preschool takes no responsibility for the cleanliness of the linen or for remembering to bring it.

The bed sheet is property of the accadis ISB Preschool. Please wash the sheet every other week as well and return it to the Preschool. If the sheet is lost, please replace it by ordering a new one at
