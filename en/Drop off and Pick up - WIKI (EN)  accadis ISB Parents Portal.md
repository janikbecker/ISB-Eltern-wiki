## Drop-off and Pick-up at the Preschool\ 

|   | Drop-off-time | Pick-up-time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full Day Program I | 07:45 to 08:55 hrs | 14:50 to 15:15 hrs |
| Full Day Program II | 07:45 to 08:55 hrs | 14:50 to 16:55 hrs on selected days according to the contract |

Children may be taken to the Preschool from 07:45 until 08:55 hrs at the latest. Parents use the Preschool entrance. The morning circle starts at 09:00 hrs prompt. Parents who arrive late wait outside at the pedestrian gate until the Morning Circle finishes. At 09:30 hrs the pedestrian gate will be opened again.

If children need to be dropped off at preschool after 09:30 or picked up in advance (e.g. in case of a doctor’s appointment), parents have to fill out the required online form to inform the school and the group teacher (latest the day before). Without this advance notice, a child cannot be dropped off late or picked up early at Preschool.

Late arrival with advance notice: please come to the pedestrian gate and ring the "Preschool" bell. An accadis employee will come and bring your child to his/her group. Early pickup with advance notice: please arrive on time at the pedestrian gate. An accadis employee will bring your child at the agreed time.

Children can generally be dropped off at the accadis Preschool until 11:30 am. Bringing them after that time is not possible.

We are happy to look after your children until 15:15 hrs. After that time supervision time ends for the groups. If you require supervision until 16:55 hrs, please enter the required option when signing the contract. Please always collect your child on time.

Preschool students can be picked up between 14:50 and 16:55 hrs. The school day and the school’s [supervision](/en/Supervision "Supervision") duty ends at 16:55 hrs. Therefore, it is important that you pick up your child punctually and reliably every day.

Please state on the Pick-up Form ( [Abholformular für Kinder der Preschool - Pick-up Form for Preschool Children](/en/images/5/5b/Abholformular_f%C3%BCr_Kinder_der_Preschool_-_Pick-up_Form_for_Preschool_Children.pdf "Abholformular für Kinder der Preschool - Pick-up Form for Preschool Children.pdf")) which persons are authorized to pick up your child. If your child is picked up by another Preschool parent, please inform the group teachers in person or via the online form well in advance.

Should there ever be a delay, please inform the school after 16:00 hrs on the usual number and follow the instructions on the recorded message. You will be forwarded accordingly. We kindly ask you to pick up your child on time and that delays remain the exception.

## Arrival of students in the morning\ 

Gates and the entrance door into the cafeteria will be opened at 07:45 hrs, and members of staff will be welcoming your children from this time. Please leave your children with them and do not come into the cafeteria yourself.

All students should arrive no later than 08:10 hrs. The doors to the cafeteria will be locked at 08:15 hrs. This is to ensure that the valuable homeroom time can be used properly by the homeroom teachers: preparing the students for the day, disseminating information, sharing news, addressing concerns and working on projects that foster the class cohesion and communication among the students. Please support the school in this by ensuring that your child arrives with plenty of time to spare.

## Late Arrival\ 

All students who arrive after 08:15 will be marked late in the attendance register. This information will also be noted in the report card.

If your child is late owing to unexpected circumstances, a school assistant is on hand near the small entrance to the school building to let your child into school and register their late arrival. Please walk younger children to the entrance and ensure that they are handed over, waiting if necessary, as the assistant may be elsewhere in the building for short periods of time and the doors are locked in this case. Please do not send your children to the visitor entrance (Am Weidenring 56) at this stage. They will be asked to return to the school building and use the entrance there.

If your child arrives at school after 09:00 hrs, for example after a doctor's appointment, please advise the school the day before via the online absence form and use the visitor entrance (Am Weidenring 56). You may be asked to wait with your child until a member of staff is available to take students to their classrooms.

## Pick-up arrangements\ 

Children in Primary and Grade 1 must be collected by an adult. All older children are allowed to leave the premises independently, if you have arranged with them to do so. Please remember that parking spaces at school are limited, so we appreciate if you park further away if you are coming by car. Please do not use the private spaces of neighboring businesses and do not block parking bays along the street. Access for the emergency services must be maintained at all times. Please respect the ‘no stopping’ signs along the road and in the roundabout. Also please do not park in the visitor's parking spaces for prolonged periods of time, but vacate the spaces as soon as possible to allow other parents to use them. Many thanks.
