As well as incorporating regular curriculum revisions, accadis ISB continuously appraises its own [curriculum](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Curriculum "Curriculum") as part of its focus on quality control. This ensures that new topics and methods can be evaluated and, if appropriate, adopted into the existing program.

Our Preschool curriculum is based on the Education Plan for children aged 0 to 10 (Bildungs- und Erziehungsplan für Kinder von 0 bis 10 Jahren).

In the Elementary School, a recognized “Ersatzschule” (alternative school), and also in Grades 5 to 10 our curriculum incorporates the Hessian core curriculum in order to ensure that our students meet the key expectations at the end of Grade 4 and Grade 10. This provides our parents and children with the security that the current standards of a typical German public school are fulfilled.

All teachers meet the requirements to receive a teaching permission by the Hessian Education Authority. Additionally, the Head of School regularly visits classes in all grades to guarantee a high level of quality.
