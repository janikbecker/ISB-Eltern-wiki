If your child is required to take medication regularly or suffers from allergies, this should be documented in your child’s student file and discussed with the Preschool or [Homeroom Teacher](https://en.wiki.accadis-isb.net/Homeroom_Teacher_and_Subject_Teacher "Homeroom Teacher and Subject Teacher").

It is possible to give a teacher permission to help your child take necessary medication. However, the teacher has to agree to give the medication. If you would like them to assist your child in this matter, please complete the form “Vereinbarung über die Durchführung von medizinischen Hilfsmaßnahmen” (available on the [Parents Portal](https://en.wiki.accadis-isb.net/Parents_Portal "Parents Portal")) and submit it to the Administrative Deputy Head.

## Special Guidelines Preschool\ 

Should your child suffer from a chronic illness or allergy, please let the Principal or your child’s group leader know. Written instructions need to be given in advance, including the type of medication, the way to administer it and the required dosage.

If a child needs to take medication during the school day, the member of staff records this on a medication form (name, date, time, medication, dosage). Medication your child had to take before or after the end of the Preschool day also needs to be recorded in such a manner.

If your child is taking antibiotics or other medication which has been prescribed to treat acute illnesses (e.g. viral or bacterial infections etc.), then it is better that they do not come to school. Sick children should stay at home and rest and only return to school when they are well again.

If your child has suffered from a contagious illness, please provide a doctor’s certificate stating that your child is no longer contagious when he or she returns to Preschool. We are aware that the Hessian Ministry for Social Affairs states that, for certain illnesses, it is not necessary to submit a doctor’s certificate. However, please understand that we require a doctor’s certificate to make sure that all at accadis ISB Preschool, teachers and children, are free of contagious illnesses and we are not spreading diseases unnecessarily or risking an epidemic.

For the following illnesses we do not request a doctor’s certificate: influenza (flu), viral gastroenteritis, fever.

If your child had a fever it must have been afebrile (without a fever) for 24 hours – **without taking medication** – before your child is allowed to return to the Preschool.
