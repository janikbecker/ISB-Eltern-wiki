To clearly demonstrate the importance of natural and environmental processes, the Preschool takes children on trips into the outside world. These include walks into fields (watching changes in nature) or trips to stores (e.g. the post office or Rewe supermarket). To get to these places, children encounter street and rail traffic. By making children aware of dangers by talking about them, sometimes supported by picture books, we educate them about appropriate behavior. It is part of our educational duty to explain both the dangers of street traffic and to practice the appropriate behavior when taking part in it. Practicing also takes place in the immediate surroundings, when going for a walk, for instance. Children can learn a lot through books, but they have to experience some situations personally to understand them.
