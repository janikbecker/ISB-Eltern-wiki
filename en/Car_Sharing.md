Why drive to school with your own car every day when there are several other accadis ISB students living near you? **Car sharing** is a good way to save gas, money and time. Additionally, you are helping the environment.

To make car sharing easy, we have created an **interactive map** that allows you to find other parents in the surrounding area of where you live. Naturally, all familiesâ€˜ names have been anonymized on this map. Contact us via the [contact form](https://www.accadis-isb.eu/isb-anfragen-inquiries) to get in touch with another family.

## Inquiry process 

1.  You check the interactive map to see which family you are interested in carpooling with. You find the interactive map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1JheU_hlsGTp6HCnmUtGYEgngI2A&ll=50.221416233629206%2C8.580290449999985&z=10).  
    
2.  You provide this information to the ISB Office via our contact form. Please provide the allocation number on file (VergabeNr), which you can find by clicking on the corresponding yellow flag on the map. Also, please provide details about your request (for example, if you are only interested in carpooling one day a week).  
    
3.  The ISB Office will contact the appropriate family and forward your contact information. By filling out the contact form, you give your consent for us to forward your contact information (email address) to the requested family.  
    
4.  If you are interested, the family will contact you directly.
