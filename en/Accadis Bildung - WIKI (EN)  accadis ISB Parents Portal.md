Since 1980 accadis pursues an integrated approach to education. Internationality, foreign languages, a scientific foundation, practical relevance and personality development thread their way through all areas and levels of education, from Preschool to Elementary School and Secondary School with the International Baccalaureate at accadis ISB, all the way to the graduation and postgraduate degree at accadis Hochschule. A traditional and values-based, family-run business, accadis has thrived without investors or an affiliated chain. Our work is centered on [quality](/ISB-Eltern-wiki/en/Quality_control "Quality control") and an academic approach.

**accadis, ad campum discere, learning in one place: that is our motto.**

### Vision\ 

accadis ISB aims to develop confident, knowledgeable and caring young people who are prepared to create a better future. Challenging programs combined with inter-cultural understanding and respect enable our students to maximize their potential and become compassionate and lifelong learners.

At accadis ISB, we offer a learning environment which allows each child to develop their social, emotional and academic potential. We inspire a love of learning in our students and challenge them to develop their academic skills as well as acquire strong social skills which are based on respect and mutual understanding. As an international school, we provide children and young people from all over the world with a broad education in a nurturing and supportive environment. Thanks to small class sizes we are able to focus on each student individually and support them according to their own individual strengths and needs.

We believe in future-oriented education. The International Baccalaurate Diploma Programme focuses on preparing students for lifelong learning and enables them to study at universities worldwide.

Every child is unique. With the aid of individualized support we therefore wish to instill a desire to learn in all of our students and for them to become self-motivated and responsible young people who enjoy coming to school. By learning in a bilingual environment alongside classmates and teachers from all over countries, we are convinced that our students do not only improve their language skills but also increase their understanding and respect for other cultures. By the time they leave school they are prepared for a life in an increasingly global society.

Our Preschool curriculum is based on the Education Plan for children aged 0 to 10 (Bildungs- und Erziehungsplan für Kinder von 0 bis 10 Jahren).

In the Elementary School, a recognized “Ersatzschule” (alternative school), and also in Grades 5 to 10 our curriculum incorporates the Hessian core curriculum in order to ensure that our students meet the key expectations at the end of Grade 4 and Grade 10. This provides our parents and children with the security that the current standards of a typical German public school are fulfilled.
