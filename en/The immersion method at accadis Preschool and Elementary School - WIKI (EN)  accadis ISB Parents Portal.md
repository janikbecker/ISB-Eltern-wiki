From the first day of school at accadis ISB, lessons are taught in English and German to all children. Immersion lessons are motivating and diverse. The goal of the teacher is to convey the subject matter and not the new language.

As the term already implies, the method involves immersion in the language, whereby a language becomes the "official" language as well as the language of everyday use. Guided by the principle “one person – one language”, one teacher speaks only German, the other only English.

Everything that is communicated in the language that is ‘foreign’ to a child is enhanced by facial expressions, gestures or demonstrations. Gradually, the child begins to access the new language independently via the context of each situation. This emulates the natural process by which children learn a language – irrespective of whether it is their mother tongue or an additional language.

Bilingual children develop their mother tongue and factual knowledge just as well or in some cases even better than monolingual children do. Immersion has gained worldwide recognition as being the most successful method of language acquisition.

In our Immersion Method, we draw on the skills of teachers, educators and assistants with either native or near native language skills. Furthermore, our faculty have teaching certification or qualifications appropriate for their role as well as bilingual experience and the necessary social competence to operate successfully in a multicultural environment.
