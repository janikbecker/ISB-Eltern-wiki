## General Information 

The settling-in period varies from one child to another; however, it should not usually exceed two weeks. Children are accompanied by a parent, who acts as a „safe haven“, staying in the background so that the Preschool staff have the opportunity to bond with the child.

In the first week, children and parents experience accadis ISB Preschool life for two days on an hourly basis and socialise with others for the first time. On the third day, short attempts to separate child and parent are made. How long the separation lasts is decided individually depending on the behavior and personal situation of the child.

The second week of the familiarization phase will be arranged according to your child’s individual needs during regular childcare hours (07:45 - 15:15 hrs). We encourage one parent to stay with the child during the first days and help her or him to become familiar with the new learning environment as well as with the future contact persons.

In week three, After School Child Care can be attended.

If the child needs an extended settling-in period, this will be discussed individually.

Settling in is complete when the child has fully accepted the Preschool teacher as a caregiver and participates in the activities of the group.

## The parents' attitude 

The attitude of the parents also contributes to a favorable or unfavorable acclimatization in Preschool. If a mother or a father can only separate from their child badly, even if subconsciously, the child will sense this and feel insecure, both before and during the acclimatization phase.

## The pedagogical staff at accadis ISB Preschool would like to see parents, ... 

-   develop confidence in the institution.
-   accept that their child is now one among others in the group.
-   do not engage in the advancement of their child without consideration for others.

## What reactions can parents expect during the settling-in period? 

Initially, a child will try to orientate itself in Preschool, and will tend to be more reluctant and observant. The child's play is not yet intensive and he or she will only gradually explore the group room. At home it might be tired and a little unbalanced. From the second week on, the child will try to find its place in the group. This can lead to more frequent conflicts with other children. It can also be the case that the child is reluctant to go to the institution in the morning or does not want to go at all. These reactions are absolutely normal.

## The mourning period 

Parents are and remain the child's most important reference persons. For this reason, it is perfectly normal for a child in Preschool to mourn the absence of its parents. However, since children are curious by nature, it is usually possible for a pedagogical specialist to distract the mourning child with attention and play-oriented ideas. It can also happen that a child only experiences the mourning phase after several weeks and suddenly no longer wants to go to Preschool. For the child the initial exciting period is now over, the daily schedule becomes routine. The child becomes increasingly aware that from now on it is expected to always go to Preschool. In such situations, it is always important to inform the pedagogical staff, in order to be able to work on this together.
